# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Logistic Regression

This project analyzes tweets to determine their **sentiment (positive or negative)** using machine learning. Built using the [Sentiment140 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140), it includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, vectorization with TF-IDF, and a Logistic Regression classifier.
